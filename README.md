Collection of small implementation for learning Rust. I created python implementations first so that I have a baseline for creating Rust programs.

In future, I expect others can contribute other programming languages.

## Expectations

1. Code should be easy to understand. No fancy one liners!
2. Code must work!
3. Add some basic tests for every code.
